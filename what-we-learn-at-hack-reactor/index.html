            <p><i> This post stems from an e-mail I wrote two weeks ago at the midpoint of Hack Reactor, a software engineering immersion program in San Francisco. Back when I was applying to Hack Reactor, nobody on the internet could nail down the exact content of the 13-week course. That's because Hack Reactor is constantly adding and removing content based on our feedback and on industry trends. Let me offer you the "Hack Reactor Curriculum, as of March 2015".</i></p>

<p><i>If you want to keep up with the latest improvements to the Hack Reactor curriculum, check out <a href="http://www.quora.com/search?q=hack+reactor">Quora</a> and the blogs of current and recent students.</i></p>

<p>Before arriving at Hack Reactor we completed a long precourse curriculum. Two precourse exercises that stand out in my memory are (1) re-implement a core JavaScript library for functional programming called <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a>, and (2) build a stripped-down version of the Twitter front-end. Everyone came into Hack Reactor with different strengths and experience. For example, some had worked in front-end development, others (including myself) had studied some computer science.  Consequently, some precourse students found the mock-Underscore very challenging and the mock-Twitter fairly straightfoward, and some (including myself) had it vice versa.</p>

<p>These differences in our backgrounds are one of the secret sauces of Hack Reactor (which is fairly unique among software engineering immersion programs because it's aimed at students with some prior coding experience). For each topic we study, there are some students who already have some exposure. We all have a chance to teach and learn from each other <a href="../run-js-code-in-sublime/">all sorts of cool techniques</a>.</p>

<p>The first six weeks we focused on pair-programming, which is an excellent configuration for fast learning (<em>see my post on <a href="../pair-programming-chopin-and-zombies/">Pair Programming, Chopin, and Zombies</a></em> ). We quickly nailed down "vanilla" JavaScript, and then took a whirlwind tour through the principle libraries that are driving the JavaScript renaissance, with names like Underscore, CoffeeScript, D3, Bootstrap, Node, Express, Bookshelf, Mongoose, Backbone, and Angular. There are lectures and solution Q/A's during the daytime. In the evenings, we've had guests come talk to us from major players such as Mozilla, npm, and Firebase. The goal has been rapid exposure, not total mastery. The knowledge will sink in as we use it. <i>Update: I wrote that last sentence hoping it would come true. Only two weeks later, I quite sure of it. For example, I understand the "MEAN stack" (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node)  much better after using it for our Legacy project. </i></p>

<p>Now we are on a semi-break week, and I'm getting chance to take care of myself and do whatever I've been neglecting. We're expected to be putting in about %50 this week on our first group project (the "Greenfield"), and it's helpful (though not required) that most of my 4-person team stayed around SF for most of the week.</p>

<p>In the second half of Hack Reactor, we will code three major projects in groups of about four students. In the "Greenfield" project, we'll hack together our first clunky product and get more familiar with "git", a popular tool for collaboration and version control. Then, all the groups will swap products: each group will inherit another group's code for their "Legacy" project, which is supposed to teach us how to approach code that someone else wrote. Finally, we'll form new groups and build the capstone "Thesis" project. </p>

<p>A few students among the earliest Hack Reactor cohorts built Thesis projects tied to some real-world company in a sort of internship arrangement. This sounded really good on paper, but it's no longer an option. Experience showed that Hack Reactor can deliver us the best and most consistent results by keeping the Thesis in-house. We'll have plenty of time to work for real companies, and get paid to do it.</p>

<p>There will be comprehensive coaching on the job search process built into the last few weeks of curriculum. Potential employers will be able to see code for all our projects on <a href="https://github.com/sdwebster">GitHub</a>, and we'll demo the Thesis products to employers at the "hiring days" job fair.</p>

<p>I am loving California so far. I love my classmates, my housemates (who are also doing Hack Reactor), and the other people I've met here. San Francisco has that West Coast vibe I've always heard of: open, relaxed, groovy. I'll likely be out here for a long while, although who knows where the job search will take me. I'll surely go back to Boston to visit often, and I promise you I will never let "hella" replace my native "wicked". </p>

<p>Hack Reactor offers a 13-week internship program called "Hacker-in-Residence" that I might apply to. HiRs are part-time Hack Reactor employees who dedicate the other 50% of their time to their own projects and self-study. HiRs do all sorts of odd-jobs. Some help students who get stuck when coding; some teach "toy problem" brainteasers; some shepherd the student body; some assist the new <a href="http://">Hack Reactor Remote-Beta</a> program; and some get involved with Hack Reactor's outreach efforts in Bay Area prisons and in Kenya. I think that any of these tasks may be a fun change-of-pace before entering market for full-time software jobs. I enjoy teaching/mentoring almost as much as I enjoy learning, and an HiR gets to do both. But on the other hand, it's also a little tempting to go ahead and use what I learned in the Real World right away, without doing HiR first. <i>(If you become an HiR, you skip the hiring days for your own classmates. Instead, you attend the next cohort's hiring days when your HiR contract is ending.)</i> Either way is a win. Either way, Hack Reactor has shown me many cool directions for self-study.</p>

<p>And no, Mom and Dad, I won't become the malicious, security-thwarting kind of "hacker" you read about in the news. Here, "to hack" simply means "to write code".</p>
